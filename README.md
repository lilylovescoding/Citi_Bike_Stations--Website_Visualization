# Self-balancing of Citi Bike Stations in New York City

## Research Inspiration
Bike sharing systems’ popularity has consistently been rising during the past years. One major factor in determining the success of any bike sharing system is **whether their implementation align with the city’s mater plan and people’s actual need**. One common phenomenon of ineffective operations and management of bike sharing system is **the unbalanced number of pick-up and drop-off at one station**.

## Datasource
The datasource comes from the official [Citi Bike website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and encompasses rides from Swptember 2019. Each row represents one trip and the columns we use in this study related to:
- Pick-up station (name and geographical location)
- Drop-off station (name and geographical location)
- Trip start time and duration

Table 1: Summary statistics of the dataset
| Number of trips                                  | 2,444,900    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Average trip duration                            | 16.8 minutes |
| Minimum trip duration                            | 1 minute     |
| Maximum trip duration                            | 33 days      |
| Number of pick-up stations                       | 805          |
| Number of drop-off stations                      | 820          |
